=== Introduction

This section contains additional information about configuring the Message Bus, including High Availability, SSL, and Error handling.

[[rabbit-message-bus-high-availability-ha-configuration]]
=== Rabbit Message Bus High Availability (HA) Configuration

The +RabbitMessageBus+ allows for HA configuration using normal https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html[RabbitMQ HA Configuration]. 

First, use the +addresses+ property in +servers.yml+ to include the host/port for each server in the cluster. See link:Application-Configuration#rabbitConfig[Application Configuration].

By default, queues and exchanges declared by the bus are prefixed with +xdbus.+ (this prefix can be changed as described in link:Application-Configuration#rabbitBusProps[Application Configuration]).

To configure the entire bus for HA, create a policy:

+rabbitmqctl set_policy ha-xdbus "^xdbus\." \'{"ha-mode":"all"}'+

[[error-handling-message-delivery-failures]]
=== Error Handling (Message Delivery Failures)

==== RabbitMQ Message Bus

NOTE: The following applies to normally deployed streams. When direct binding between modules is being used, exceptions thrown by the consumer are thrown back to the producer.

When a consuming module (processor, sink) fails to handle a message, the bus will retry delivery based on the module (or default bus) retry configuration. The default configuration will make 3 attempts to deliver the message. The retry configuration can be modified at the bus level (in +servers.yml+), or for an individual stream/module using the deployment manifest.

When retries are exhausted, by default, messages are discarded. However, using RabbitMQ, you can configure such messages to be routed to a dead-letter exchange/dead letter queue. See the https://www.rabbitmq.com/dlx.html[RabbitMQ Documentation] for more information.

NOTE: The following configuration examples assume you are using the default bus +prefix+ used for naming rabbit elements: +"xdbus."+

Consider a stream: +stream create foo --definition "source | processor | sink"+

The first _pipe_ (by default) will be backed by a queue named +xdbus.foo.0+, the second by +xdbus.foo.1+. Messages are routed to these queues using the default exchange (with routing keys equal to the queue names).

To enable dead lettering just for this stream, first configure a policy:

+rabbitmqctl set_policy foo.DLX "^xdbus\.foo\..*" \'{"dead-letter-exchange":"foo.dlx"}' --apply-to queues+

To configure dead-lettering for all streams:

+rabbitmqctl set_policy DLX "^xdbus\..*" \'{"dead-letter-exchange":"dlx"}' --apply-to queues+

The next step is to declare the dead letter exchange, and bind dead letter queues with the appropriate routing keys.

For example, for the second "pipe" in the stream above we might bind a queue +foo.sink.dlq+ to exchange +foo.dlx+ with a routing key +xdbus.foo.1+ (remember, the original routing key was the queue name).

Now, when the sink fails to handle a message, after the configured retries are exhausted, the failed message will be routed to +foo.sink.dlq+.

There is no automated mechanism provided to move dead lettered messages back to the bus queue.


*Automatic Dead Lettering Queue Binding*

Starting with _version 1.1_, the dead letter queue and binding can be automatically configured by the system. A new property +autoBindDLQ+ has been added; it can be set at the bus level (in +servers.yml+) or using deployment properties, e.g. +--properties module.*.consumer.autoBindDLQ=true+ for all modules in the stream. When +true+, the dead letter queue will be declared (if necessary) and bound to a dead letter exchange named +xdbus.DLX+ (again, assuming the default +prefix+).

In the above example, where we have queues +xdbus.foo.0+ and +xdbus.foo.1+, the system will also create +xdbus.foo.0.dlq+, bound to +xdbus.DLX+ with routing key +xdbus.foo.0+ and +xdbus.foo.1.dlq+, bound to +xdbus.DLX+ with routing key +xdbus.foo.1+.

NOTE: This just sets up the DLQ and binding, you still need to set a policy to enable dead lettering on the queues, routing failed messages to +xdbus.DLX+:

+rabbitmqctl set_policy DLX "^xdbus\..*" \'{"dead-letter-exchange":"xdbus.DLX"}' --apply-to queues+

==== Redis Message Bus

When Redis is the transport, the failed messages (after retries are exhausted) are +LPUSH+ed to a +LIST ERRORS:<stream>.n+ (e.g. +ERRORS:foo.1+ in the above example in the _RabbitMQ Message Bus_ section).

This is unconditional; the data in the +ERRORS LIST+ is in "bus" format; again, some external mechanism would be needed to move the data from the ERRORS LIST back to the bus's foo.1 LIST.

[[rabbitssl]]
=== Rabbit Message Bus Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

If you wish to use SSL for communications with the RabbitMQ server, consult the https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html[RabbitMQ SSL Support Documentation].

First configure the broker as described there. The message bus is a client of the broker and supports both of the described configurations for connecting clients (SSL _without certificate validation_ and _with certficate validation_).

To use SSL without certificate validation, simply set 

----
spring:
  rabbitmq:
    useSSL: true
----

In +application.yml+ (and set the port(s) in the +addresses+ property appropriately).

To use SSL with certificate validation, set 

----
spring:
  rabbitmq:
    useSSL: true
    sslProperties: file:path/to/secret/ssl.properties
----

The +sslProperties+ property is a Spring resource (+file:+, +classpath:+ etc) that points to a properties file, Typically, this file would be secured by the operating system (and readable by the XD container) because it contains security information. Specifically:

----
keyStore=file:/secret/client/keycert.p12
trustStore=file:/secret/trustStore
keyStore.passPhrase=secret
trustStore.passPhrase=secret
----

Where the +pkcs12+ keystore contains the client certificate and the truststore contains the server's certificate as described in the rabbit documentation. The key/trust store properties are Spring resources.

NOTE: By default, the +rabbit+ source and sink modules inherit their default configuration from the container, but it can be overridden, either using +modules.yml+ or with specific module definitions.

=== Rabbit Message Bus Batching and Compression
See link:Application-Configuration#rabbitBusProps[RabbitMQ Message Bus Properties] for information about batching and compressing messages passing through the bus.
