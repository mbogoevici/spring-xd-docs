=== Instructions

Here are some useful steps to build and run Spring XD.

To build and bundle the distribution of Spring XD

----
./gradlew zipXD
----

The above gradle task creates spring-xd zip file under build/dist. This will also create 'spring-xd' directory which is the expanded version of this zip file.

To just create the Spring XD distribution directory

----
./gradlew distXD
----

The above gradle task creates the distribution directory under build/dist.

Please note that both the above tasks will clean build/dist directory as they run.

Once the distribution directory is created, please refer link:https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-xd/wiki/Getting-Started[Getting Started] on how to run Spring XD.
