=== Instructions

Here are some useful steps to build and run Spring XD.

To build all sub-projects and run tests for Spring XD (please note tests require a running http://redis.io/[Redis] instance):

----
./gradlew build
----

To build and bundle the distribution of Spring XD

----
./gradlew dist
----

The above gradle task creates spring-xd-<version>.zip binary distribution archive and spring-xd-<version>-docs.zip documentation archive files under 'build/distributions'. This will also create a 'build/dist/spring-xd' directory which is the expanded version of the binary distribution archive.

To just create the Spring XD expanded binary distribution directory

----
./gradlew copyInstall
----

The above gradle task creates the distribution directory under 'build/dist/spring-xd'.

Once the binary distribution directory is created, please refer to link:https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-xd/wiki/Getting-Started[Getting Started] on how to run Spring XD.

=== IDE support

If you would like to work with the Spring XD code in your IDE, please use the following project generation depending on the IDE you use:

For Eclipse/Spring Tool Suite

----
./gradlew eclipse
----

For IntelliJ IDEA
----
./gradlew idea
----

Then just import the project as an existing project.

=== Running script tests

Apart from the unit and integration tests, the directory `src/test/scripts` contains set of scripts that run end-to-end tests on XD runtime. Please see the instructions to setup and run:

* Once XD is built (with copyInstall), from the distribution directory: `build/dist/spring-xd/xd/bin/xd/bin/xd-singlenode(.bat)`
* Setup XD_HOME environment variable that points to `build/dist/spring-xd/xd`
* From the directory `src/test/scripts`, run `basic_stream_tests`
* For the `jdbc_tests`, we need to run `install_sqlite_jar` first that installs sqlite jar into `$XD_HOME/lib`
* For the `hdfs_import_export_tests`, make sure you have setup hadoop environment and have the `xd-singlenode` started with appropriate hadoopDistro option and hadoop lib jars for the version chosen
* For `tweet_tests`, make sure you have the twitter properties updated before running the tests
