=== Introduction

Spring XD provides a browser-based GUI which currently has 2 sections allowing you to

* perform Batch Job related tasks
* deploy/undeploy Stream Definitions

Upon starting Spring XD, the Admin UI is available at:

http://localhost:9393/admin-ui

=== Streams

The _Streams_ section of the admin UI provides the _Definitions_ tab that provides a listing of Stream definitions. There you have the option to *deploy* or *undeploy* those streams.

=== Jobs

The _Jobs_ section of the admin UI currently has four main tabs for *Batch Jobs*

* Modules
* Definitions
* Deployments
* Executions

==== Modules

Modules encapsulate a unit of work into a reusable component. Within the XD runtime environment Modules allow users to create definitions for <<Streams>> as well as <<Batch Jobs>>. The *Modules* tab within the *Jobs* section allows users to create Batch Job definitions. In order to learn more about modules, please see the chapter on <<Modules>>.

===== List available batch job modules

This page lists the available batch job modules and more details (such as the job module options and the module XML configuration file).

===== Launching a batch Job

Once the job is deployed, they can be launched through the Admin UI as well. Navigate to the *Deployments* tab. Select the job you want to launch and press `Launch`. The following modal dialog should appear:

.Launch a Batch Job with parameters

Using this screen, you can define one or more job parameters. Job parameters can be typed and the following data types are available:

* String (The default)
* Date (The default date format is: _yyyy/MM/dd_)
* Long
* Double

===== Schedule Batch Job Execution

The same screen also contains a list of the executed steps:

.Job Execution Details - Steps

From there you can drill deeper into the _Step Execution Details_.

===== Step execution details

The Step Execution details screen also provides a complete list of all Step Execution Context key/value pairs. For example, the _Spring for Apache Hadoop_ steps provides exhaustive detail information.

.Step Execution Context
